# Assigns a predicate to a correlation clustering operator if a predicate has hard-constraints associated with it which specify the
# three properties of equivalent relations

# reflexive: ocoref(a,a)
# transitive: ocoref(a,b),ocoref(b,c)=>ocoref(a,c)
# symmetric: ocoref(a,b)=>ocoref(b,a)

# Kenya assigns the remaining predicates to the MLN operator
